# Run isoworld

All commands run from the repo root.

## Install once

```sh
npm install
```

## Serve

```sh
sh tools/serve.sh
```

The server listens on `http://localhost:8765/` (set `PORT=` to change it). Open:

- `http://localhost:8765/?level=home&seed=1` for both builds side by side
- `http://localhost:8765/3d/index.html?level=home&seed=1` for the 3d build alone
- `http://localhost:8765/2d/index.html?level=home&seed=1` for the 2d build alone

`?level=dev` loads `levels/dev.json`, the engine test island.

## Query parameters (3d)

| Param | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `level` | Level file under `levels/`, default `home` |
| `seed` | Seed for per-cell colour jitter, default `1` |
| `pitch`, `yaw` | Camera angles in degrees, default from the level's `view` block, then 35.264 and 45 |
| `tileH` | World height of one stack level, default 1 |
| `zoom` | Pixels per world unit; 0 or absent fits the level to the viewport |
| `spawn` | `x,z` start cell override |
| `hero` | `0` hides the hero, for reference comparisons |
| `dpad` | `1` forces the on-screen d-pad |
| `view` | Root page only: `both`, `3d`, or `2d` |

## Controls

W/A/S/D or the arrow keys walk one cell per step: W up-right, D down-right, S down-left, A up-left. Click or tap a cell to path there. Touch devices get a d-pad.

## Render and compare

```sh
node tools/shot.mjs "http://localhost:8765/3d/index.html?level=home" out/home-3d.png 351 390
node tools/compare.mjs ref/reference.png out/home-3d.png out/home-3d
node tools/smoke.mjs "http://localhost:8765/3d/index.html?level=dev"
```

`shot.mjs` waits for `window.__done` and prints page errors. `compare.mjs` prints `MAD  NCC  silhouette` and writes `out/home-3d-side.jpg` and `out/home-3d-overlay.jpg`. `smoke.mjs` drives the keys and a tap and prints the hero's cell after each.

## Level view block

A level may carry `"view": { "pitch": 35.264, "yaw": 45, "tileH": 1, "zoom": 0 }`. Query parameters override it.
